# ðŸ’§ Water Potability Prediction App

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether drinking water is **potable (safe)** or **non-potable** based on its physicochemical properties. Built using Streamlit and trained on real-world water quality data.

## ðŸ§  ML Models Used
The notebook evaluates multiple models:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) âœ… *Best performer*
- Random Forest

The final app uses a tuned **SVM model with 92%+ accuracy**.
